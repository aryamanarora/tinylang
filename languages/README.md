# Language Configs

Each subfolder of `languages` includes YAML files containing configs for the language ablation. Some subfolders include a `make_sweep.py` file to construct these configs.

In the paper, we report results from the following:
* Section 5.1: `ar_vary_kv/ar_32.yaml`
* Section 5.2: `pcfg_vary_difficulty`
* Section 5.3: `pcfg_train_test_split`
